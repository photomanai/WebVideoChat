# Web Video Chat ðŸ’¬ðŸ“¹

This project is a modern browser-based video chat application built with `Node.js`, `Express.js`, and `Socket.IO`.
It allows users to join unique rooms and share video and audio streams in real time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication:** Uses `WebRTC` (Web Real-Time Communication) to establish direct peer-to-peer connections between browsers.
- **Dynamic Rooms:** Users can join dynamically generated rooms.
- **Video & Audio Controls:** Basic controls such as toggling microphone and camera.
- **Participant List:** A collapsible list displaying all participants in the room.
- **Responsive Design:** UI built with Tailwind CSS for seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Signaling via Socket.IO:** The signaling process (offer, answer, ICE candidate) required for WebRTC connections is securely handled with `Socket.IO`.

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (preferably LTS version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/photomanai/WebVideoChat.git
   cd WebVideoChat
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install express socket.io ejs
   ```

3. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the App:**
   Open your browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Important: HTTPS Requirement ðŸ”’

WebRTC requires a **secure context** (HTTPS) in production. Running the app on plain HTTP may cause the camera and microphone not to work.

For local testing, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server with HTTPS:

```bash
# Run the server locally
node server.js

# In another terminal, run ngrok
ngrok http 3000
```

ngrok will provide you with a public HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://random-id.ngrok.app`).
Share this URL with your friends to join the same room securely.

## Usage

- Go to the homepage (`/`) to create a new room or join an existing one.
- Enter a unique room ID (`roomId`) and share the link with your friends.
- Once inside, allow access to your **microphone** and **camera**.
- Use the bottom control buttons to manage video/audio settings.
- Click the **participants icon** at the bottom-right to see whoâ€™s in the room.
- To leave the meeting, click the **Leave** button.
